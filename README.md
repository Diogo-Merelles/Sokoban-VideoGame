// Project description
A one-week group project developed with 4 other code cadets after classes in our while at <Academia de CÃ³digo_>.

// The Idea
Our idea was to make a Sokoban kind of game, where the objective is to drag JS boxes into another marked area with the face of one of our Master coders. If you would make the wrong move and got stuck we would be able to restart the game.

// The Development
We set the project objectives and constructed a class diagram UML. Our MVP was having a player to be able to move JS boxes in a maze to another marked Area. We started to make a grid where the player could be inserted.
After implementing movement with a keyboard handler, we had to manage to implement the collision factor so that the player would know what is a box and what is a wall. After that we managed to create 5 levels each with increasingly dificulty and a re-start button implemented in each level, in order to re-start the level you are at, in case you would make a wrong move.
We managed to finish the project in one week, and the final result was better than we ambitioned for, at first. It turned out to be a fun project that made us smile!
